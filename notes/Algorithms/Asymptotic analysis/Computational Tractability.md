## 2.1: Computational Tractability

- Proposed Definition of Efficiency:
	1. An algorithm is **efficient** if it performs well on real input instances.
	2. An algorithm is **efficient** if it performs _quantitatively better_ than brute-force search in worst-case scenarios.
	3. An algorithm is **efficient** if it runs in _polynomial time_.

- A **Brute-force search** is a straightforward but typically inefficient approach involving the examination of all possible solutions
