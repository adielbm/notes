- A **circle** $\bigcirc$ is the locus of points in a plane that are at a fixed distance $r$ (the **radius**) from a fixed point $O$ (the **center** of the circle).
	- The **circumference** $C=2\pi r=\pi d$ is the length of one circuit around the circle
	- The area enclosed by a circle is equal $A=\pi r^2$.
	- A **diameter** is a line segment whose endpoints are on the circle and passes through the center of the circle. 
		- The **diameter** $d=2r$ is the length of any diameter.
	- A **chord** is a line segment whose endpoints are both on the circle.
		- Every chord in the circle is inside the circle.
		- The longest chords in a circle are the diameters.
		- Let $AB$ and $A'B'$ be two chords in the circle. Then $\overline{AB} = \overline{A'B'}$ if and only if $\angle AOB = \angle A'OB'$
	- A **secant** is a line that intersects the circle at two points.
	- A **tangent** is a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point.
		- A tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius to the tangent point
		- A tangent to the circle is a straight line passing through a point on a circle, and perpendicular to the radius to this point, is a tangent to the circle
	- A **radius** (plural: **radii**) is a line segment whose endpoints are the center of the circle and a point on the circle.
	- A **(circular) arc** is the arc of a circle between two distinct points on the circle.
		- Arc Length $s=r\theta$
	- A **segment** of a circle is a region bounded by a chord and its minor (or major) arc.
	- A **sector** of a circle is a region bounded by two radii of the circle and an arc intercepted by those radii.
		- Area of a sector of circle $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2$



- An **inscribed angle** is the angle formed in the interior of a circle when two chords intersect on the circle
	- (**Inscribed angle theorem**) An **angle $θ$ inscribed** in a circle is half of the central angle $2θ$ that subtends the same arc on the circle. Therefore, the angle does not change as its vertex is moved to different positions on the circle.
		- (**Thales's theorem**) if $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct points on a circle where the line $AC$ is a diameter, the angle $∠ ABC$ is a right angle.
- A **central angle** is an angle whose vertex is the center of the circle and whose sides are radii of the circle.



 


	- The sum of two inscribed angle subtends on the same chord on both sides is $180^\circ$

- A straight line and a circle intersect in at most two points.



- Every triangle have a unique circumcircle

- A square can be circumscribed in a circle if and only if the sum of each pair of opposite angles in it is $180^\circ$.
- Inside each triangle has a unique circumscribed circle
- The center of the circumscribed circle is the point of intersection of the triangle's perpendicular bisectors.
- The locus of points in triangle $\triangle ABC$ that are equidistant from sides $AB$ and $AC$ is the bisector of the angle $\angle BAC$.
- Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle whose area is $S$, perimeter is $k$, and the radius of the inscribed circle is $r$. The following exists: $S = \frac{k \cdot r}{2}$
