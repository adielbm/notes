- The **distance** between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $d=\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-y_{1})^2 }$
- The **midpoint** $M=(x_{m},y_{m})$ of a line segment joining the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\displaystyle M=(x_{m},y_{m})=\left( \frac{{x_{1}+x_{2}}}{2},\frac{{y_{1}+y_{2}}}{2} \right)$

| Two-point form | $\displaystyle  y-y_{1}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}(x-x_{1})$ | $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are any two points of the line, (if $x_{1}\neq x_{2}$ then $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\tan(\theta)$ is the slope) |
| Slope–intercept form (y) | $y=mx+y_{0}$ | assuming non-vertical line. $y_{0}$ is y-intercept |
| Slope–intercept form (x) | $y=m(x-x_{0})$ | assuming non-horizontal line. $x_{0}$ is x-intercept |
| Standard Form | $Ax+By=C$ |  |
| Point–slope form | $y=m(x-x_{0})+y_{0}$ | $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ is any point of the line. (assuming non-vertical line) |
| Intercept form | $\displaystyle{\frac {x}{x_{0}}}+{\frac {y}{y_{0}}}=1$ | assuming the line is not parallel to an axis and does not pass through the origin. The intercept values $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ are nonzero |


- **Angle Between Two Lines** - If two nonperpendicular lines have slopes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, then the tangent of the angle between the two lines is $\displaystyle\tan \theta=\left|{\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}}\right|$

- If two nonvertical lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal.
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\parallel \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}=m_{2}$
- If two lines (neither horizontal nor vertical) are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is $-1$. 
	- Alternative Form: $\ell_{1}\perp \ell_{2}\iff m_{1}m_{2}=-1$ where neither $\ell_{1}$ nor $\ell_{2}$ is a vertical line or a horizontal line.





- Let $\ell_1, \ell_2$ be two non-vertical lines in the plane (so their slopes $m_1, m_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ exist), and let $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ be the angles they make with the **positive** $x$-axis, (i.e. $m_i=\tan\alpha_i$ for $i=1,2$), and let $\theta\in\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ be the angle between them. Then: 
	- $\ell_1\parallel\ell_2\iff m_1=m_2\iff\alpha_1=\alpha_2$.
	- $\ell_1\perp\ell_2\iff|\alpha_2-\alpha_1|=\tfrac\pi2\iff m_1m_2=-1$.
	- $\ell_1\not\perp\ell_2\implies \displaystyle\tan\theta=\left|{\frac{m_2-m_1}{1+m_1m_2}}\right|$.
- If $m=0$ is the slope of a line $\ell$, then 
- A line $\ell$ is said to be **horizontal** if its slope is $m=0$.
- A line $\ell$ is said to be **vertical** if $\ell=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\mid x=a\}$ for some $a\in\mathbb{R}$, i.e. if it is parallel to the $y$-axis. It has no slope.
- A line $\ell$ is said to be **oblique** if it is neither horizontal nor vertical.
