- Let $\gamma: I \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be  a continuous function, where $I\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an interval.
	- The **curve** defined by $\gamma$ is the set $\gamma(I) = \{ \gamma(t) \mid t \in I \}$.
	- The function $\gamma$ is called the **parameterization** of the curve.
	
	- $\gamma(t)=(x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_n(t))$ for $x_i: I \to \mathbb{R}$.
	- The variable $t$ is called the **parameter** of the curve.
- (_Remark_: A curve can have multiple parameterizations.)
- A curve is **simple** if $\gamma$ is injective. 
- A curve is **closed** if $I=[a,b]$ and $\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)$.
- A curve is **regular** if $\forall t \in I, \gamma'(t) \neq 0$.
