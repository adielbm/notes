Hi, I’m Adiel. This site contains the notes I’ve been taking since the fall of 2022 to organize my learning in computer science.

I write them in Markdown using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), generate a static site with [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) (customized with the [Flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki) color scheme), and host it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adielbm/notes/).

These notes are just my personal summaries, so they may contain mistakes. I update them from time to time. Hope you find them useful!
