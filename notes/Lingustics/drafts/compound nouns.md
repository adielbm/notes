What you’re describing involves compound nouns or noun phrases, where one noun (“B”) modifies or specifies the meaning of another noun (“A”). These constructions often appear in English to create a more specific meaning than the head noun (“A”) alone.  
  
Common Examples:  
1. Hyponymy (Subset Relation):  
• “Baroque pop” → A type of pop music.  
• “Cylinder lock” → A type of lock.  
• “Solar energy” → A type of energy.  
• “Digital camera” → A type of camera.  
In these cases, “B A” refers to a specific subset of “A”.  
2. Functional Modifiers (Not Hyponyms):  
• “Office chair” → A chair used in an office (not necessarily a subset of all chairs).  
• “Chicken soup” → A soup made with chicken (not necessarily implying that it’s the only kind of soup).  
• “Wedding ring” → A ring associated with weddings (not every ring is a wedding ring).  
These examples specify the function, use, or association of the head noun, without necessarily implying subset membership.  
3. Metaphorical or Non-Literal Phrases:  
• “Chocolate box” → A box containing chocolates, not a type of box in itself.  
• “Brain storm” → A storm in the brain, metaphorically referring to intense thought or creativity.  
4. Non-Hyponymous Relationships:  
• “Security camera” → A camera used for security purposes. This does not necessarily mean it’s a type of camera distinguished only by design—it’s more about its intended use.  
• “Toy car” → A toy shaped like a car, not a type of real car.
