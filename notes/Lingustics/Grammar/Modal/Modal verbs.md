## General formal properties of modal verbs

- Modal verbs have only one form and do not inflect for person or number.
- Modal verbs do not have infinitive forms, either with *to* or without. 
- Modal verbs have no *-ing* form and no *-ed* participle form and therefore lack progressive and perfect forms
- Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a lexical verb or an auxiliary verb (be, do, have) or the substitute verb do, but cannot be another modal verb.
- Modal verbs cannot be used as lexical verbs. (*~~I must to bed~~,* *~~I should your help~~,*)
- Modal verbs can only stand alone when the lexical verb is understood. (*A: He might have a phone. B: Yes, he might.*)

## Comparisons

### *can*, *could* and *may*

##### permission

**Could** is usually heard as more formal and polite than can, and **may** is the most formal/polite of the three.

##### probability 

**Can** refers to what the speaker believes to be a factor to be usually the case. **Could** and **may** refer to possible events.
**Could** and **may** rather than **can** are used to speculate about whether something is true or possible.

### *could*, *may* and *might*

##### probability

Could, may and might are all used to express degrees of certainty. May expresses a slightly greater degree of certainty than could, and tends to be used in more formal contexts. Might is more tentative than may or could.

## Replacements for Modal

- The modals _can_ and _could_, in their meanings expressing ability, can be replaced by _am/is/are able to_ and _was/were able to_. Additional forms can thus be supplied: the infinitive _(to) be able to_, the subjunctive and (rarely) imperative _be able to_, and the participles _being able to_ and _been able to_.
- The modals _may_ and _might_, in their meanings expressing permission, can be replaced by _am/is/are allowed to_ and _was/were allowed to_.
- The modal _must_ in most meanings can be replaced by _have/has to_. This supplies the past and past participle form _had to_, and other forms _(to) have to_, _having to_.
- _Will_ can be replaced by _am/is/are going to_. This can supply the past and other forms: _was/were going to_, _(to) be going to_, _being/been going to_.
