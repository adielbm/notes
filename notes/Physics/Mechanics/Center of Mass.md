# Center of Mass (CM)

- The **center of mass** of a system of particles is the point that moves as though all the system's mass were concentrated at that point
- $\displaystyle \vec{R_\text{cm}}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\vec{r}_{i}$ is the center of mass of a particles $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ with masses $m_{i}$ and position vectors $\vec{r}_{i}$, where $\displaystyle M=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}$ is the total mass of the system
