# Electric current

- Electric current is the flow of electric charge
- $\displaystyle I=\frac{dq}{dt}$
	- $I$ is the **electric current** of the circuit (in $\mathsf{A}$)
	- $q$ is the electric charge has passed through some surface in the circuit up to time $t$ (in $\mathsf{C}$)
	- $t$ is interval during which the charge flows (in $\mathsf{s}$)
- The SI unit of current is the **ampere** (abbreviated $\mathsf{amp}$ or $\mathsf{A}$), defined as $\mathsf{1\ A = 1\ C/s}$
- A current is **positive** if it flows from the positive terminal of a voltage source to the negative terminal

## Conventional current

- The conventional direction of current, also known as **conventional current**, is arbitrarily defined as the direction in which positive charges flow

	- electric current from $+$ to $-$ is equivalent to a negative electron flow from $-$ to $+$
	- conventional current combines the effects of electron, ion, proton, and hole flows all into one number.
	- Positive conventional current always flows from a high potential to a low potential.
	- conventional current is not the opposite of electron current
	- Electron current is a subset of conventional current. 
- A 19th-century convention, still in use, treats any electric current as a flow of positive charge from a region of positive potential to one of negative potential.
	- The real motion, however, in the case of electrons flowing through a metal conductor, is in the opposite direction, from negative to positive.

## Alternating current (AC)

- $V=V_0\sin(\omega t)$ is the voltage of an alternating current (see [[Waves#Sine Wave|sine wave]])
	- $V_0$ is the **peak voltage** (in $\mathsf{V}$) (the _amplitude_)
	- $\omega=2\pi f$ is the angular frequency (in $\mathsf{rad/s}$) where $f$ is the frequency (in $\mathsf{Hz}$)
	- $t$ is time (in $\mathsf{s}$)
- $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{V_0}{R}\sin(\omega t)=I_0\sin(\omega t)$ is the current of an alternating current
	- $I$ is the current (in $\mathsf{A}$)
	- $R$ is the resistance (in $\mathsf{\Omega}$)
	- $I_0$ is the peak current (in $\mathsf{A}$)
- $P=I^2R=I_0^2R\sin^2(\omega t)$ is the power transformed in a resistance $R$ at time $t$
	- Because the current is squared, the power is always positive
	- The average power is $\overline{P}=\frac{1}{2}I_0^2R$
- The [[Means#Continuous Functions|rms]] values of sinusoidally alternating currents and voltages are:
	- $I_{\text{rms}}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$
	- $V_{\text{rms}}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}$
