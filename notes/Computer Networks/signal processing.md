- The difference between the original continuous analog signal and its digital approximation is called the **quantization error**
- The **resolution** (or **bit depth**) is the number of bits or values for the voltage of each sample (=measurement)
- The **sampling rate** is the number times per second the original analog voltage is measured ("sampled")
- **ADC** (analog-to-digital converter) is a device that converts a continuous analog signal to a discrete digital signal
- **DAC** (digital-to-analog converter) is a device that converts a digital signal to an analog signal

- Spectral band
- frequency band

- Digital data
- A **digital signal** is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values
- analog signal
- analog data 


- The **spectrum** $[f_\text{low}, f_\text{high}]$ of a signal is the range of frequencies it contains 
- The **bandwidth** (רוחב סרט) of a signal is defined as $\text{Bandwidth} = f_\text{high} - f_\text{low}$ (unit: Hz)
	- The **effective bandwidth**
